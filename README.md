# Data-Broker
We’re building a data refinery for AI companies with a customer to company pipeline. 

We’re building a data refinery for AI: instead of just collecting or labeling new data like Scale, Mercor, or Luel, we ingest massive amounts of raw, messy, existing data from universities, enterprises, and contributors, then use AI to sort, filter, score, and extract the small subset that’s actually valuable for training models. The product turns “data lakes” and junk corpora into model-ready, high-signal training datasets that we can either return to the owner or broker to AI labs and enterprises. In short: they sell labor and data collection; we sell signal and data intelligence.
